Detection optimized sub-network based on node scores and edge scores in metabolic correlation network

Develop an efficient algorithm to detect optimized subnetwork based on node scores and edge scores in metabolic correlation network in R software


Both node and edge scores are derived from log-likelihood ratio test statistic of P-values from multiple testing of the nodes (association with clinical outcome) and the edges (permutation test of the correlations) adjusting for overall FDR level, and the result is presented in Joint Statistical Meeting 2016 at Chicago
